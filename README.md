- 👋 Hi, I’m Voldthehuman!
- 👀 I’m interested in LUA(contributing to open source UI addons) relearning the fundementals of Vanilla JS in order to create a better base of trunk knowledge and
      strengthen my current knowledge of React JS.
       My coding journey started four years ago when I moved to NYC with an ex girlfriend and didn't want to continue down the path of employment that I currently had at 
        that time. Four years later, I'm still here. In the same career choice field that I was several years ago, although I have stepped down from management, I'm still
        in the food service industry and I'd like to take after my father, a developer of over forty years. Thanks dad
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a couple of open source projects available during Hacktoberfest 2023 and a few personal projects I intend to bring to the app stores
      next year.
- 📫 You can reach me via discord @ Vold#4824, via email at @ pointblankcoding@gmail.com or jwritesmusic@gmail.com
